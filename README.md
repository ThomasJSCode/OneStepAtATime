# OneStepAtATime
A basic, Windows-friendly, console-based memory game.

## About This Project
This is a simple game wherein the objective is to move your "character" through a randomly-generated obstacle course (of sorts) with the use of WASD inputs to the console. Safely navigate through the course and you win; collide with a wall and the game ends.

The twist, however, is that -- assuming you are playing this game as intended, on a Windows OS -- the course will only be visible for a few seconds. Once the game starts, you'll have to use your wits and your memory to make it through -- one step at a time.

As of this release, the game will always initiate on "easy mode", though there are implementations for higher difficulties in the DisplaySetup class -- beware though, the Medium and Hard difficulties can be... oppressive.

For future releases, I would *like* to add a hint-giving system (which will probably be all but necessary on higher difficulties), a scorekeeping system, and basic Linux support. Beyond that, given the limited scope and function of the game, this project will likely remain dormant, unless someone else has interest in picking this up and improving it further.
