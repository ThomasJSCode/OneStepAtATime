# OneStepAtATime
A basic, Windows-friendly, console-based memory game.

## About This Project
This is a simple game wherein the objective is to move your "character" through a randomly-generated obstacle course (of sorts) with the use of WASD inputs to the console. Safely navigate through the course and you win; collide with a wall and the game ends.

The twist, however, is that -- assuming you are playing this game as intended, on a Windows OS -- the course will only be visible for a few seconds. Once the game starts, you'll have to use your wits and your memory to make it through -- one step at a time.

As of this release, the game will always initiate on "easy mode", though there are implementations for higher difficulties in the DisplaySetup class -- beware though, the Medium and Hard difficulties can be... oppressive.

Looking back at this project some months later, I'm admittedly not highly pleased with how this "game" came out, though I maintain that it was at least thoughtfully designed. Part of me wishes I had initially written this as a web-based game -- which would alleviate the current ghastly, console-based presentation, which is my biggest lamentation about it -- but I still think it's _okay_ as a first project.

If I were to continue working on this, I would *like* to add a hint-giving system (which will probably be all but necessary on higher difficulties), a scorekeeping system, and basic Linux support. Beyond that, given the limited scope and function of the game, this project will likely remain dormant, unless someone else has interest in picking this up and improving it further.
